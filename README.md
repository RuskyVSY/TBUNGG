This program controls a game based on the popular phone game "Piano Tiles". The point of this game
is to hit the buttons underneath the "falling" green LEDs as they reach the last position. The rate at which the LEDs
move down keeps on increasing. For every LED that is hit correctly, a point is rewarded. The game is lost if a single
LED is missed. An LED display has also been implemented in order to display the player's score and the highscore. If
the current highscore is reached or beaten, the box next to the game opens, revealing the contents. If the highscore
is not met, the box flips over.

Pictures of the hardware in testing stages are included.
